Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradign based on the concept "Object".

Encapsulation:is the practice of bundling data and methods that operate on that data into single unit,or class

Abstraction:focuses on hiding unnecessary details while exposing only the essential features of an object 

Inheritance:Allows one class (child) to acquire  the properties and behaviours of another class(parent).

Polymorphism:Enables objects to be treated as intances of their parent class while allowing behaviour to be customized in child classes.
